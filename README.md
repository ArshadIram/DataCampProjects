# DataCampProjects

In this repo, I have listed all the projects which I have done in DataCamp during learning Data science and Machine learning courses. 

**This current project is:** can a machine identify a bee as a honey bee or a bumble bee? These bees have different behaviors and appearances, but given the variety of backgrounds, positions, and image resolutions it can be a challenge for machines to tell them apart. This notebook walks through loading and processing images. After loading and processing these images, they will be ready for building models that can automatically detect honeybees and bumblebees.



**Besides, I have also performed other projects which are listed below:**
